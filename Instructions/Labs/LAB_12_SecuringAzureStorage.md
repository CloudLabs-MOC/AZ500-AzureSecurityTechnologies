# Lab 12: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage

## Lab scenario
You have been asked to create a proof of concept to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. Specifically, you want to:
- Create a storage endpoint so traffic destined to Azure Storage always stays within the Azure backbone network.
- Configure the storage endpoint so only resources from a specific subnet can access the storage.
- Confirm that resources outside of the specific subnet cannot access the storage. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:
- Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2022 computer

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPublic**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

6. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane, then paste and run the same PowerShell script that you ran within the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This time, you will receive the **New-PSDrive : Access is denied** error. 

    >**Note**: Access is denied because the *myVmPublic* virtual machine is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for the Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet.

7. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has outbound connectivity to the internet: 

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will succeed because there is no network security group associated with the Public subnet.

8. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Public subnet cannot access the storage account, but has access to the internet.
