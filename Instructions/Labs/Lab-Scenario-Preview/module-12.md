# Lab Scenario Preview: AZ-500: Secure Data and Applications

## Lab 12: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage
You have been asked to create a proof of concept to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. Specifically, you want to:
- Create a storage endpoint so traffic destined to Azure Storage always stays within the Azure backbone network.
- Configure the storage endpoint so only resources from a specific subnet can access the storage.
- Confirm that resources outside of the specific subnet cannot access the storage. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

### Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:
