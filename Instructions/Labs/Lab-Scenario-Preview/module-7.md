# Lab Scenario Preview: AZ-500: Implement Platform Protection

## Lab 07: Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups
You have been asked to implement your organization's virtual networking infrastructure and test to ensure it is working correctly. In particular:
- The organization has two groups of servers: Web Servers and Management Servers.
- Each group of servers should be in its own Application Security Group. 
- You should be able to RDP into the Management Servers, but not the Web Servers.
- The Web Servers should display the IIS web page when accessed from the internet. 
- Network security group rules should be used to control network access. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.
